"""Native persistent long-term memory for Nicx.

This package provides the automatic memory service that extracts durable facts
from conversations in the background and persists them across sessions. It is
started and stopped as part of the ``nicx serve`` / ``nicx chat`` lifecycle
and configured via the ``[memory]`` section of ``config.toml``.
